## Actors

### 1. Lead (person interested in buying a home)

- **Description:** person interested in acquiring their first home who does not know whether they meet the requirements to be a mortgage-credit subject.
- **Functions:** enter their financial/employment data; view their "financial health" diagnosis and follow the improvement-plan recommendations.
- **Technology handling:** intermediate (3).
- **Context knowledge:** low (1).
- **Justification:** as a first-time buyer, they don't know the banking requirements (income, required down payment, delinquency, employment history) or the technical jargon of the real estate/financial sector. However, as an average digital user, they handle web and mobile apps fluently at a general-user level.

### 2. Sales Executive

- **Description:** the real estate company's sales professional, responsible for closing deals.
- **Functions:** view the dashboard with the portfolio of pre-qualified leads in green/eligible status; filter prospects by scoring and contact viable clients.
- **Technology handling:** medium-high (4).
- **Context knowledge:** high (5).
- **Justification:** expert context knowledge — they master the real estate sales flow and credit requirements. Medium-high tech handling, as they already operate digital commercial-management tools such as CRMs and ERPs day to day.

### 3. Real Estate Admin

- **Description:** representative of the real estate company that contracted the service.
- **Functions:** assignment of executive roles within the company.
- **Technology handling:** intermediate (3).
- **Context knowledge:** high (5).
- **Justification:** expert context knowledge of the sales flow and credit requirements. Intermediate tech handling — they mostly operate their company's software and general tools (email, Excel), and struggle with new tools.

### 4. Admin Dev (development administrator)

- **Description:** representative of the system's development team.
- **Functions:** handling of traceability, logs, security, and manual adjustment of user scores.
- **Technology handling:** high (5).
- **Context knowledge:** intermediate (3).
- **Justification:** intermediate context knowledge, built from own research and client interviews. High tech handling — responsible for developing and maintaining features, so they understand the system architecture in depth and know the tools that make up the system.
